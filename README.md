This project is in the process of development. 

I consider that this project is an important step in my web-development progress. Unlike my previous projects, this one is made for a client and this will be deployed and used.
My client has an Airbnb guest house and he wants a web-page that will showcase his location. Also, he wants to include information about the city and the local tourist attractions.

The live page is found at the following URL:
